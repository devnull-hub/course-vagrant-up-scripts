# course-vagrant-up-scripts

This is from the [Vagrant Up! Comprehensive development system automation](https://www.udemy.com/course/vagrant-up/) Udemy course using a `vmware box` image. The course material is dated and you will need to do some modificaitons with finding the correct `box vmware` image that will work. Some of the newer `httpd` used a different configurations and security, so more work if you want something newer. Opted out with finding older image. Some tweaking will be needed. Just getting through the basic concepts and will modify at later.
